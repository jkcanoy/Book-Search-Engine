## Description

This application is a book search engine that uses Google Books API, and has been refactor to use Apollo Client Serve instead of RESTful API.

Users are able to login or signup and create a new account. They are then able to search for a book in the search bar. A list of books with an image, title, author, and description will populate the page. Users are able to save a book and add that to their list of saved books. Users can see their list of saved books in the See Your Books tab and remove books from their list as well.
